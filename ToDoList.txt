-(In progress) Need a new component, probally a child of mainContent, to display an expanded list of sections for faster navigation
-Need to work on compatability with smll screens/mobiles.  Current nav menu is broken
-(Done but needs testing) Look at autologin when first browsing to site
-Need to optomise code, theres lots of repeated methods/functions, and lots of unessasary calls
-Generally improve UI and look of the app from feedback
-Need to do something with the home screen, either add a quick search function or some links etc.
