                <h4>Welcome to My Genetic Evolution Simulator!</h4>
                <p class="tagline">Read on to get started!</p>

                <h5>Quick Start Guide:</h5>
                <p>I recommended refreshing without cache (CTRL + SHIFT + R) before getting started to ensure you have the latest version.  Blazor tends to cache JavaScript very aggressively.</p>
                <p>Select a performance preset from the top to get a good starting point.</p>
                <p>You can then use the settings tabs to alter specific settings.  You can save your current settings locally and re-upload them for later use, including which settings are favourited.</p>
                <p>Click Start/Reset, Simplified Start or Super Simplified Start from the top right menu to begin.</p>
                <p>Start/Reset will respect all current configurations, Simplified Start will simplify the neural network output, remove the energy system, some score bonuses, and a few other things and Super Simplified Start will also give the agents a preset body plan and force symmetry, reduce body and brain shape mutation, fix the map and some other things as well.</p>
                <p>Using full configurations will result in more interesting behavior, but will take 500+ generations to see much progress, Simplified Start should see much faster learning, with agents completing the maps within a few hundred generations, and Super Simple can complete the maps in 50-100 generations depending on the map.</p>
                <p>You can also use one of my pre-trained genome pools to skip the first generations, but you are then restricted to my settings.  Some of the older populations may have broken with updates over time.</p>
                <p>The current agent pool is auto-saved to browser storage every generation, so if you have a crash, or close without saving, hit the amber button to attempt to recover.</p>
                <p>Clicking 'Run Top Agents Ever After Batch' will mean that after the current run ends, it runs the 10 top agents ever from this population on the current map.</p>
                <p>Use the button bank in the top right to toggle rendering of the leading agents brain/neural network, their vision lines/ray casts, switch between different agents or fast-forward generations.</p>
                <p>You can also save the current set of agents genomes locally so you can continue training later.  This saves the current settings alongside the agents Genomes so they continue with the same setup.</p>
                <p>The simulation tries to maintain the frame-rate around 40 fps, if its significantly lower or higher than that on average, it will decrease or increase the simulation speed.</p>
                <p>The skip x generation buttons will disable the rendering and allow a slightly lower fps.  However, rendering only adds about 5-10% to the processing time per frame, so it might only by a little faster.</p>
                <p>Please save genomes regularly so you can recover from bugs and crashes.  Clearing your browsers data seems to break my backup system, requiring the database to be manually deleted from indexedDB.  I am looking for a way around this.</p>
                <p>I have not tested all settings in all configurations, its very easy to break things!</p>
                <p>You can also update any settings mid-run using the update button.  This works well for things like swim strength or world properties, but will break for most agent properties.  I have not tested this extensively.</p>
                <p>If anything breaks, such as the population size, a settings update, a failed mutation etc, the first thing to try is to 'Stop' or reset, and then 'Recover Auto Save' which sorts it most of the time.  I recommend saving regularly in case this does not work.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, the simulation should be accurate if the FPS is above about 15.  Any lower than that, the physics engine starts to rely on guesses for locations rather than hard calculations.  If another windows takes priority, it will try and run some parts of the sim in the background, but at reduced accuracy.</p>

                <h5>Settings To Play With</h5>
                <p>Aside from performance settings and numbers of agents, there are many settings that effect training and starting conditions.  Some of the more interesting are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Min and Max number of starting limbs.</li>
                    <li>Swim Strength, Joint Speed and Liquid Viscosity.  Together effect agents movement.  Swim Bias gives a bias to forces parallel to the agents facing direction</li>
                    <li>Starting Limb Chain Length, which means agents start with either 1 set of limbs, 2 or 3, where subsequent sets are attached to the ends of the previous.</li>
                    <li>Maximum and Minimum starting neural network layers.</li>
                    <li>Different score and energy configurations.</li>
                    <li>Different training settings, like migration rate, top performers to keep and mutation rates.</li>
                    <li>Using simple network output will significantly aid learning, at the cost of more direct control.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h5>Some Explanation:</h5>
                <p>This is my take on a NEAT style genetic evolution simulation.  It's not actually using the NEAT algorithm, as far as I can tell it's not possible using TensorFlow.js due to requiring dynamic models for networks.</p>
                <p>I have however, used many of the principals talked about in the original paper.  Unlike most evolution sims using neural networks, my agents brains can evolve in shape as well as weights.  Mutating the number of layers and nodes per layer was not too complex, but performing crossover on networks that dont match in shape is a non trivial task.</p>
                <p>The original paper solved this in 2 ways, 1 was specialization, where agents with similar shaped networks where selected as parents, making crossover easier, and creating different species groups that arose naturally, and also by keeping track of mutated network features using IDs, and deciding whether to keep new mutated features from one parent or the other.</p>
                <p>This is where TensorFlow.js limits come into play.  In NEAT proper, the neural networks are not static or restricted to rows  of specific numbers of neurons.  It was built on a system that allows any neurones to connect to any others, regardless of depth in the network.  They are generally still feed froward, but just not in the neat format of rows and nodes TensorFlow.js is restricted to.</p>
                <p>There are a number of ways around this.  I thought about having large numbers of redundant nodes per row, and redundant rows, and just using some connections and nodes and leaving others dead, essentially a sparsely connected network.  Those sparse connections could mimic the more random connection structure needed.  I think this is possible, but it would be complicated to crossover.  You would have to group neurons into 'features' that are crossed over and find ways to maintain already existing connections to maintain learning.  This would also have large memory overheads in redundant nodes</p>
                <p>The solution I have ended up using is a node-to-node ID system.  Each node is given a unique ID, and each connection is identified as the fromNodeID and toNodeID that they connect to.  I can then use a system of checks to see if nodes and layers exist in both parents, and chose which to keep.  Networks are still restricted to densely connected, rigid networks, but they can gain or loose nodes and layers.</p>
                <p>A feature of my simulation thats missing from most NEAT implementations is the ability for agents to evolve their body plan over time as well a their brains.  This can result in some interesting and complex bodies over time.</p>
                <p>I have implemented the ability to see agents brains on screen, but this seems to add a fair amount of CPU overhead.  It should only be toggled on for a while, it seems to cause memory issues after a while</p>
                <p>I am making use of P5.JS for my rendering, Planck.JS; a port of Box2D, for my physics and TensorFlow.JS for my neural network processing.  Thanks to Blazor WASM's service workers, this application should run fine offline, though some browsers may never load it without an initial internet connection.</p>
                <p>I started building the first version of this just for a bit of fun.  I had seen lots of YouTube videos of similar projects and wanted to try and emulated them as a way to learn.  I read the NEAT paper when it first published, and have wanted to explore this direction ever since.  The project has since evolved somewhat; I'm not really sure the end goal, but it's become a bit of a passion project over the last 12 months.  I've thought about making it a teaching tool or something similar, but I have no idea if there is any use for it.  It's really just here to teach me!  Please do email me at samw.denton@gmail.com if you have found this tool and have any use for it or any suggestions!</p>
                <p>There is some further information on the history of the project on the <a style="text-decoration: none" href="/Projects/all/all">Projects Page of the Wiki</a></p>

                <h5>So whats going on?</h5>
                <p>If you start the simulation with default settings, you will see about 10-20 agents on the screen, representing the top scorer from each group, a random agent per group, the agent that has made it furthest, and the trailing agent.  Which agents are on screen can be configured.</p>
                <p>Default settings will produce 500 agents in the population, split into batches of species groups, denoted by colour.  10-50 agents from the run group are evaluated at a time, with a random selection of species</p>
                <p>There are a number of settings that will effect performance.  The pre-sets should handle these, but you may want to adjust a few.  The main ones will be the 'Number Of Agents' which is the number of agents to run at a time.  This is multiplied by 'Groups Per Generation' to get the total number of agents in the population.  Also the 'Agents Per Batch of Joint Updates', which is how many agents are updated per frame.  Ideally, each agent should get a minimum of 2 updates per second, as more updates gives more control.  This is measured and displayed in the bottom right of the sim.  Having this number about 1/10th the number of agents is about right.</p>
                <p>On my PC, using a Ryzen 7 3700X CPU about 3.5Ghz per core, I can target about 100 agents at a time, with 10 Agents Per Batch of Joint Updates.  The Number of Inter-gen Batches will not effect performance, but will increase training time, as only 1 batch can be evaluated at a time</p>
                <p>Since i'm making use of JS, the bottleneck for most systems is going to be the speed of a single CPU core.  Some configurations may reach a browser memory limit before a CPU limit, if you have a high number of inter-gen batches.  Browsers I have tested seem ok up to about 1000 agents total</p>
                <p>Since it's single threaded, you can run many instances of my sim at once without much performance hit!</p>
                <p>The GPU is also utilized for any Neural Network functions, the most intense of which happen between rounds, so it doesn't really matter how long they take, but during the simulation, the actual decision making also utilities the GPU using WebGL.  I have not found a configuration where this is the bottleneck, but its possible</p>
                <p>Each round, the agents have 2000 ticks, about 34 seconds at 60 fps with default physics speed of 60, to move as far North East as possible.</p>
                <p>The agents are all given a randomly initialized neural network, with a random shape for a brain, the leaders brain can be rendered.  They are given a random body plan.  Both the brain and the body plan will evolve over time based on a number of crossover and mutation functions</p>
                <p>Between rounds, the agents are sorted by score, where the top 10% from each species are selected to remain unchanged, and the other 90% of the population is built using crossover and mutation.</p>
                <p>This is performed between generations, on the whole population</p>
                <p>Crossover is the function of picking 2 parent agents and combining the weights and biases in their brains, keeping some features from one, and some from the other.  There are a range of methods for this, I am currently using biased Arithmetic Crossover, where there is a weighted bias given by the relative scores of the parents.</p>
                <p>Mutation adds a small chance that each weight, bias, limb or body will be altered by a small, random amount.  Again, there are many methods, currently i am using the Box-Muller transform to get a Gaussian random number for my mutation amount.  I have a function that changes the mutation rate if agents brains get too close to the average</p>
                <p>I am currently also mutating the number of limbs and layers in the brain.  These are more complex to mutate than others, as they tend to produce 'dead' agents that need retaining from scratch, which naturaly cant compete with already trained agents.  I am playing with a number of methods to counter this.</p>
                <p>Now, when a new limb is mutated, it finds an existing limb with a similar starting angle, and copies the weights from that limb.  When a new layer is mutated, it should create a matching layer, where biases are copied from the previous layer, and weights are connected so the old node connects to its new copy with a weight of 1, and all other weights are 0 in the new layer, hopefully copying the previous layers function until new values are evolved.</p>
                <p>The parents for crossover can be selected in many ways, I am actually using 1 method for 1 parent, and another for the other.  The first is picked via tournament selection, where 10 random agents are selected from the group, and the best of those if picked.  The second is picked via a weighted random selection, where ever agent is entered into a lottery with more entries for a higher score, and a random agent is picked from the pool.</p>
                <p>I am also using 'Island Populations' or 'Island Speciation', where parents are always picked from the same distinct group.  This means, with default settings, 5-10 distinct populations should evolve with different strategies.  There is a small chance that parents are picked from a different group, allowing some sharing of strategies</p>
                <p>You should see some 'evolution' within  50 or so generations, and they can continue to improve indefinitely, however, they can get stuck in whats known as a 'local maxima' where the agents converge on 1 or a few ok strategies, and never seem to improve.  Through mutation, they might eventually, but in those situations, it can be best to restart.  A greater number of agents or distinct population groups can help with this</p>
                <p>If enabled, I am experimenting with a form of normalization which slowly decays all weights in the network over time.  It's meant to prevent any noise in the network over time, based on a 'use it or loose it' principal.  Useful connections should be maintained by re-selection and unused connections will drop away</p>
                <h5>Current Selective Pressures:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Score for movement North East</li>
                    <li>Bonus for joint movement that diminishes over time</li>
                    <li>Exploration bonus</li>
                    <li>Size bonus, multiplied by movement</li>
                    <li>Larger limbs give more swimming force</li>
                </ol>
                <h6>Energy System:</h6>
                <ol>
                    <li>Starting energy based on body size, larger bodies can store more energy</li>
                    <li>More energy is used to move larger limbs</li>
                    <li>Agents limb movement speed is based on their remaining energy %, with no energy, they cant move at all</li>
                </ol>

                <h5>Future Plans</h5>
                <p>I want to use an OpenAI API integration to pick values for starting configurations to produce better populations over time.</p>
                <p>I want to add the agents internal map of covered ground as an input so they know where they have already explored.  I could also include the last few generations maps for that agent so it can see where it explored in previous generations.  This will require significantly more complex brains, longer training time and reduced agents per run group, as well as possibly larger populations.</p>
                <p>A similar idea thats easy to implement is to record the agents last few x and y positions, or whole input state, at update times and give those as inputs as well, as this would show agents their last few moves</p>
                <p>I need to re-implement the agent output selectors, and allow agents to evolve inputs and outputs list.</p>
                <p>I would like to implement modularity in the neural network structure, so sections or modules of nodes and layers are combined to create the whole network.  These modules can then be treated individually and swapped about.</p>
                <p>If I switch from storing the full population genome as a JS object to storing it in IndexedDB, I can achieve much greater total population numbers.  Currently, about 700 is the limit.  I can also make the agents object more efficient</p>
                <p>There is a lot of clean up work to do on the code, the genome and the agent objects.  I have lots of duplicated values and old structures.  I am not making use of 'const' enough, and I am duplicating functions in places</p>
                <p>I need to work on the maps.  They are too simple and not varied enough.  I want to implement some goals, like food, tied to the energy system.  A puzzle to open a door or similar could also be interesting</p>
                <p>I plan on adding further ways the agents can evolve. I want to allow more complex body plans with different types of limb and body segments, such as wings, thrusters, suckers, energy storage limbs etc</p>
                <p>I want to add a greater range of crossover, mutation and selection methods to increase diversity, and have them toggle in settings to play with different combinations</p>
                <p>I am also going to introduce a diversity metric that gives score bonus for being different from other agents, and also increases an agents mutation rate if it is too similar to the average agent.</p>
                <p>I want to add a way to save and load agents to an online repo like git hub, so top agents can be shared.</p>
                <p>I want to add the ability to see genomes on screen somehow</p>
                <p>I want to play around with a predator and prey scenario, where some agents learn to catch others</p>
                <p>There are many different ways to adjust the energy system to see more interesting evolution, such as food, recovering energy by resting, reducing update speed based on energy, adding limbs just for energy storage etc</p>
                <p>I have created a few different versions of my mutate and crossover functions, I would like to let the user pick which is used.  I need to get the old ones working first</p>
                <p>Could look at implementing another idea from NEAT, where agents are given a metric based on their properties, and have a higher chance to reproduce with similar agents.  This can create species groups even within my island populations, leading to a greater variety of solutions.  This may require larger populations to work well, 100-200 agents per group, where I currently have 25 per group.</p>
                <p>I would love to make use of parallelization to spread some load across CPU cores, but JS makes this difficult.  Initial inquiries suggest its doable, but sharing memory states across CPU cores will be a challenge.  As a first step, creating a custom Electron implementation could help increase the available memory and give more control over resource use, but would still be very tricky to parallelize across CPU cores.  I think the easiest way would be to just have multiple instances of the program running at once, and between generations, the agent pool is transfered between the 2 and split back up.</p>
                <p>Currently, my crossover methods both treat each neuron independently, it would be good to also allow groups of neurons to be transfered together so learned features are maintained.  I have implemented a basic version of this with my layer swapping function.</p>
                <p>Small one, but now that populations have been training for thousands of generations, I would like to add a button that appears after the round length reaches maximum that lets you toggle on and off the first x generations of the graph.</p>
                <p>It might be interesting to have toggle dynamic group sizes like NEAT.</p>
